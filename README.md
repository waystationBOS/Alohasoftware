This repository contains restricted software.  
To protect security, licensing, and the integrity of the project, **do not share these files with anyone else**.

## 📜 Guiding Principles

- **Respect licensing**: Unauthorized distribution violates license terms and may create legal or financial risk.
- **Protect security**: Reuploads or mirrors can introduce malware, altered files, or outdated versions.
- **Honor effort**: This software represents time and skill. Sharing without consent disrespects that work.
- **Ensure consistency**: Centralized access guarantees users get the correct version with proper documentation.

---

## ✅ Allowed

- Personal use as outlined in the license or granted access.
- Internal team use via official channels.
- Linking to official sources when someone requests access.

---

## ❌ Not Allowed

- Uploading, mirroring, or attaching binaries/installers to third‑party sites.
- Sharing passwords, license keys, or private links.
- Distributing patched or repackaged builds.
- “Friend favors” — even trusted colleagues must request access officially.

---

## 🔑 Access Requests

- Use the official contact or issue template in this repo to request access.
- Provide intended use, organization, and compliance needs.
- Requests are reviewed for licensing, security, and support impact.
- Access may be revoked if misuse is detected.

---

## ⚠️ Consequences of Unauthorized Sharing

- Immediate removal of access credentials.
- Security response: invalidation or rotation of files/keys.
- Possible legal escalation for license violations.
- Loss of collaboration privileges.

## ❓ FAQ

- **Can I share with my colleague?**  
  Only if they request and receive approval.

- **Can I host a mirror?**  
  No. Mirrors fragment support and increase risk.

- **Can I post screenshots or docs?**  
  Public documentation is fine; restricted docs are not.

- **What if someone urgently needs it?**  
  Urgency does not override policy. Direct them to the official request channel.
